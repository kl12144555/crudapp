OAP provides the envelope for sending Web Services messages over the Internet/Internet. It is part of the set of standards specified by the W3C. SOAP is an alternative to Representational State Transfer (REST) and JavaScript Object Notation (JSON).

SOAP envelope
The SOAP envelope contains two parts:

An optional header providing information on authentication, encoding of data, or how a recipient of a SOAP message should process the message.
The body that contains the message. These messages can be defined using the WSDL specification.
SOAP commonly uses HTTP, but other protocols such as Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP) may by used. SOAP can be used to exchange complete documents or to call a remote procedure.

NOTE: SOAP at one time stood for Simple Object Access Protocol. Starting with SOAP Version 1.2, the letters in the acronym have no particular meaning.

Also see how SOAP is used in the ebXML Message Service Specification (MSS).
